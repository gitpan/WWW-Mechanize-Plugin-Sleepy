NAME
    WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Sleepy - A WWW::Mechanize plugin to provide the
    behaviour of WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy while using
    WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
    Set all Mechanize objects to sleep for 5 seconds between requests:

        use WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable Sleepy => [ sleep => 5 ];

    or, set single Mechanize instance to sleep for 5 seconds between
    requests:

        use WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable;
    
        my $mech = WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable->new( sleep => 5 );

    To change sleep time:

        $mech->sleep(2);    # now sleep for 2 seconds per request

    To sleep for a random number of seconds, specify the range as a string
    in the following format:

        'i1..i2'
    
        # e.g. will sleep between 5 and 10 seconds, inclusive
        $mech->sleep('5..10');

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes it easy to slow down WWW::Mechanize when using
    WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable, in the manner of WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy.

    The code merely adds hooks containing a "sleep()" before several
    WWW::Mechanize methods, but is possibly preferable to scattering
    "sleep()"s throughout code in order to slow down tests, for example.

METHODS
  sleep
        $mech->sleep(1);
        $mech->sleep('5..10');
    
        my $sleep = $mech->sleep;

    Get/set sleep time
